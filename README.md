## How to Play Three Card Poker

- The player places a bet.	
- You are dealt 3 cards face up.
- The dealer is dealt 3 cards face down.
- The player can now decide if they want to double their bet, or “fold” their hand and give up.
- If the player folds, the hand is over and the dealer wins.
- If the player continues with a bet, their hand is compared against the dealer’s hand.
- If the player’s hand is better, he wins the appropriate payout (see table below)
- If the dealer’s hand is better, the player loses.
